## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser

3. Select either **DCMP** (District Championship) or **WCMP** (World Championship)
4. View team rankings, event schedules, and qualification probabilities

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **API**: [The Blue Alliance API v3](https://www.thebluealliance.com/apidocs)
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with CSS Variables for theming
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design with media queries

## API Key

The application uses a TBA API key for fetching data. The key is embedded in the JavaScript files:

```javascript
const TBA_API_KEY = 'z8FSCVQr1QXVxRFn6GgWOfmVrTtQQ1GUxvs78aCgrigr6JqQaZZRdET6AIZ9Gm80';
```

## Calculation Methodology

### DCMP Qualification
- Teams ranked within the district's DCMP slot count are considered
- **Locked**: Gap to cutoff > remaining points OR qualified via award
- **In Contention**: Within mathematical reach of qualification
- **Eliminated**: Cannot reach cutoff even with maximum remaining points

### WCMP Qualification
- Top teams from DCMP advance to World Championship
- Approximately 1/3 of DCMP slots advance to Worlds
- Same color-coding logic applies

### Freeze Logic
- **DCMP Page**: Stops updating when all non-DCMP district events are complete
- **WCMP Page**: Stops updating when the DCMP event is complete
- Prevents outdated calculations after events conclude

## Browser Compatibility
